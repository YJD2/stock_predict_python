# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements various methods for stock price prediction and analysis using Python. It combines traditional financial models with modern machine learning approaches to forecast stock prices.

## Features

### 1. Dividend Discount Models
- Implementation of basic DDM for stock valuation
- Multi-stage DDM for complex growth scenarios
- Handles explicit dividend forecasts with future growth assumptions

### 2. Machine Learning Price Prediction
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network implementation
- Real-time stock data fetching using yfinance
- Price prediction for next 7 days
- Data normalization and sequence creation
- Training/testing split functionality

## Requirements

```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow
sklearn
yfinance
```

## Key Components

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Historical stock price data fetching
   - Data normalization using MinMaxScaler
   - Sequence creation for LSTM input

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Two LSTM layers (50 units each)
   - Dense layers for final prediction
   - Adam optimizer with MSE loss function

3. **Visualization**
   - Historical vs Predicted prices plotting
   - Future price prediction visualization
   - Interactive matplotlib graphs

## Usage

1. **For Dividend Discount Model:**
```python
dividend_discount_model(D1, r, g)
# D1: Expected next dividend
# r: Required rate of return
# g: Growth rate
```

2. **For LSTM Prediction:**
```python
# Load stock data
stock_data = yf.download('TICKER', start='YYYY-MM-DD', end='YYYY-MM-DD')

# Train model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Results

The model provides:
- Short-term price predictions (7 days ahead)
- Visualization of historical vs predicted prices
- Confidence metrics for predictions

## Notes

- The LSTM model requires sufficient historical data for accurate predictions
- Model performance may vary depending on market conditions
- Regular retraining is recommended for maintaining prediction accuracy
- Consider market conditions and external factors when using predictions
